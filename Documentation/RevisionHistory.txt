v3.4b6d1 Changes

WARNING: This is a development version of the next beta. This means that it
contains a change which is extensive enough and untested enough that I do
not recommend it being used by most people. If you're an experienced user,
please try it and let me know your experiences with it. If you have been
having problems with events not showing up, or if people have trouble
signing up for your events then try this build and let me know if it fixes
the problem. Once I'm confident that the new code is working correctly I'll
release this as just plain v3.4b6 for general testing.

- Fixed bug which could cause event or attendance updates to be ignored
- Replaced the Calendar window icon with a functioning copy of the minimap clock
- Fixed bug causing tooltips to be shown on dates with no events

The logic to handle incoming event and attendance updates has had extensive
(though contained) changes made. This should fix certain problems with events
not showing up or with people not getting processed while signing up for an
event. This change has not been tested in a large guild environment though
and so should only be used by experienced users or those who're experiencing
these specific problems.

  a database until he sees it offered on his own network.  This should prevent
  unguilded toons from clearing the database cache as well as preventing toons
  in other guilds from spreading events between the guilds.
  
v1.2b1 Changes

- Added event cleanup so that events older than 45 days are automatically
  removed, except for birthdays which are rescheduled for the same time next year
- Added ability to display and edit events in local date and time instead
  of server date and time

v1.1 Changes

- Changed dungeon order to be by level instead of by English alphabetical
  order
- Added Simplified and Traditional Chinese translations
- Fixed bug with Trust tab names not working correctly for names that
  didn't start with a Roman letter
- Fixed crash when switching to windowed mode on Macintosh clients
- Fixed minor layout bugs

v1.1b23 Changes

- Fixed nil pointer bug when reconstructing databases from their
  change history

v1.1b22 Changes

- Fixed nil pointer problem whene executing attendance changelists
- Fixed bug which caused events which don't have a type to not be
  added correctly to other people's calendars
- Added icon for events which don't have an event type
- Changed calendar button to use the GameTimeFrame as a parent so that it hides
  or moves if a UI changes the time frame
- Fixed store auto config so that the config data isn't cleared accidentally
  if an officer uses manual config but doesn't select a config player

v1.1b21 Changes

- Added Battlegrounds events (I know, I shouldn't be adding features
  this late but this really belonged in 1.0 with the other dungeons
  and it was only omitted because of my light battlegrounds experience)
- Modified calendar icon rendering to avoid icons for events it doesn't
  understand.  This will allow new event types to be added in the future
  without causing the calendar to render ugly green squares.

v1.1b20 Changes

- Added support for key binding to show/hide the calendar.  This was a trivial
  change which should make life a little easier for people using heavily
  customized UIs.
- Updated BFD icon with new artwork
- Changed database ID to be a timestamp instead of a sequence number.  This fixes
  Rebuild Database so that you only have to hit it once to make it clear up the
  network and also fixes initialization so that throwing away your settings file
  will clear your old database from the network.
- Modified update handling so that changes are only made after the update is
  received.  This fixes problems with partial updates being sent out on the
  network while they were still in progress as well as fixing problems caused
  by updates being promised but never arriving.

v1.1b19 Changes

- Fixed bug causing guild trust level to be calculated incorrectly

v1.1b18 Changes

- Increased startup delay to 2 minutes but added code which shortens it
  to 10 seconds when the General channel is joined.  This should make
  startup quick for people who don't experience significant login lag
  but still be long enough to ensure that /1 doesn't go to the calendar
  channel if there is a lot of lag
- Fixed bug causing attendance requests to be ignored by the event owner
  under some circumstances
- Fixed excess traffic when requesting authoritative updates
- Fixed live updating of UI when new event data arrives
- Modified trust UI to hide rank dropdown when trust group isn't set to guild

  as "Pending approval"
- Changed minimap icon to be smaller, more discrete so that the sun and
  moon could shine through

  events not showing up or attendance requests not getting confirmed.
- Fixed local time calculation when server time is near midnight
- Updated Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj icon

v1.1b16 Changes

- Increased delay until channel initialization after login
- Added more status messages during initialization

v1.1b15 Changes

- Changed channel initialization to provide detailed error information when
  the password fails or the number of allowed channels is exceeded

v1.1b14 Changes

- Fixed local time calculation so it occurs on PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD event
  instead of VARIABLES_LOADED.  The server time value doesn't appear to be
  reliable at VARIABLES_LOADED time.
- Restored the old Dire Maul event icon
- Lowered the saturation of BRD, MC and RFC icons for better appearance
- Modified RebuildDatabase to repair event IDs if there are any collisions
- Fixed bug causing changes to be lost during update event processing.  This
  was causing events to disappear right after they were created but could
  also cause other problems such as attendees disappearing or changes to
  events reverting to the original event values.
- Added support for separate update request for owner revision and shared revision

v1.1b13 Changes

- Fixed bug which caused drunken chat strings to be escaped in a different
  format than they were being un-escaped, causing damaged messages.  I 
  really shouldn't program at 2am, really.

v1.1b12 Changes

- Updated Onyxia icon with new artwork
- Added check for invalid packet on UPD (DB or RAT) message
- Added support for intoxicated players
- Changed protocol to GC2 since it isn't compatible with the drunk escaping

v1.1b11 Changes

- Fixed *another* bug causing nil pointer errors during certain updates

v1.1b10 Changes

- Fixed bug causing nil pointer error during certain updates
- Added attendance total to attendance panel

v1.1b9 Changes

  create event updates from that.  This should improve reliability

  database if the owner provides data that differs from proxied updates

v1.1b7 Changes

  and Meetings

  to the current date

  and feedback comments so they can be properly transmitted
- Added 5 and 6 hour choices to the Duration menu
- Attendance list for meetings is now sorted by is/isn't attending instead
  of by class
- Attendance list names are now sorted alphabetically
- Minimap date/time tooltip now also displays the day of the week
- Birthday events no longer show an attendance tab
